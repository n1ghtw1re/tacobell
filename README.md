## Project Overview: Mandated Digital Interface

This repository contains the official static web presence simulation for the sole remaining restaurant franchise following the conclusion of the Franchise Wars: Taco Bell, San Angeles Division. This interface is designed according to **San Angeles Societal Harmony Protocols**, emphasizing cleanliness, efficiency, and aesthetically compliant futuristic design (predominantly whites, subdued neon purple, and sleek chrome finishes).

This project serves as a demonstration of building a fast, efficient, secure, and maintainable static business website using **only core web technologies**: HTML5, CSS3 (with CSS Variables), and Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+). No extraneous frameworks or libraries were utilized, ensuring optimal performance and minimal resource consumption, as mandated by efficiency standards.

## Key Features & Information Sectors

This digital portal provides access to the following authorized information sectors:

*   **Home (`index.html`):** Primary welcome interface. Introduces the fine dining experience and core tenets of Taco Bell's societal role. Features hero banner, introductory sections, and career opportunity vectors.
*   **Menu (`pages/menu.html`):** Displays the curated list of nutritionally optimized, synth-authentic sustenance options available. Includes a visual gallery of standardized presentations.
*   **Franchise Wars (`pages/franchise-wars.html`):** Historical archive detailing the conflict that established Taco Bell's benevolent culinary monopoly.
*   **Locations (`pages/locations.html`):** Directory of ubiquitous fine dining access points throughout the San Angeles megalopolis, complete with integrated network map display.
*   **Careers (`pages/careers.html`):** Portal for citizens seeking harmonious employment and wishing to contribute to societal well-being through service at Taco Bell.
*   **Three Seashells Guide (`pages/three-seashells.html`):** Official guidance on utilizing the mandated personal sanitation protocol. *(Note: Clarity may be restricted to authorized personnel.)*
*   **Nutritional Compliance (`pages/nutritional-compliance.html`):** Documentation outlining adherence to San Angeles Health Protocol 8.1, including prohibited constituents and standardized nutritional profiles.
*   **[REDACTED TRANSMISSION] Easter Egg:** An unauthorized data intercept simulation accessible through non-standard interaction protocols within the interface footer. *(See Below)*

**Dynamic Functionality:**

*   **Partial Loading:** Utilizes Vanilla JavaScript (`js/script.js`) to dynamically fetch and inject reusable header and footer components (`partials/header.html`, `partials/footer.html`) across all sectors, ensuring interface consistency and maintenance efficiency. Handles relative path resolution.
*   **Active Navigation:** Dynamically highlights the currently active sector link in the main navigation bar for enhanced user orientation.
*   **Dynamic Year:** Automatically updates the copyright year in the footer using JavaScript.

## Technology Stack (Approved Components Only)

*   **Structure:** HTML5 (Semantic Elements Employed)
*   **Styling:** CSS3
    *   CSS Variables (for efficient theme parameterization)
    *   Flexbox & CSS Grid (for compliant, responsive layouts)
    *   Responsive Design (Adapts to various mandated viewport dimensions)
*   **Interactivity:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
    *   DOM Manipulation
    *   `fetch` API (for partial loading)
    *   Asynchronous Operations (`async`/`await`)
*   **Fonts:** Google Fonts ('Exo 2') - *External dependency noted for compliance review.*
*   **Backend/Database:** None. This is a fully static interface, ensuring maximum security and minimal server load.

## Accessing the Digital Portal (Setup & Usage)

As this is a purely static interface, no complex build process is required.

1.  **Acquire Project Files:**
    *   **Option A (Recommended):** Clone the repository using Git:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/[n1ghtw1re]/demolition-taco-bell.git
        cd demolition-taco-bell
        ```
    *   **Option B:** Download the project files as a ZIP archive and extract them.

2.  **Initiate Interface:**
    *   Navigate to the project directory in your file explorer.
    *   Open the `index.html` file in any modern, compliant web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

The interface should now be fully operational locally.

## Configuration (Design Compliance Parameters)

Key visual parameters are defined using CSS Variables in `css/style.css` within the `:root` selector. Adjust these values to modify the core theme (subject to aesthetic compliance review):

css
:root {
    --primary-bg: #ffffff;
    --secondary-bg: #f4f4f9; /* Very light lavender */
    --accent-color: #ab47bc; /* Subdued Neon Purple */
    --accent-glow: rgba(171, 71, 188, 0.3);
    --chrome-color: #b0bec5; /* Sleek Chrome/Silver */
    --text-color: #444;
    --heading-color: #212121;
    /* ... etc. */
}

### Alert: Unauthorized Transmission Detected (Easter Egg)

An anomaly has been detected. Interaction with the "E.Friendly" link unit within the standard footer (partials/footer.html) initiates a simulated system instability event, followed by redirection to a non-standard terminal interface (pages/edgar.html).

Investigate this anomaly with caution.

### Submitting Enhancement Proposals (Contributing)

While this interface is deemed fully optimized, proposals for enhancement adhering strictly to San Angeles design and efficiency protocols may be submitted via standard GitHub Pull Requests. All submissions are subject to rigorous compliance review. Ensure proposals maintain the core technological stack (HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS only).
