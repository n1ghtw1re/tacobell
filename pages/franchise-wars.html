                <h2>The Great Restaurant Purge</h2>
                <p>A comprehensive historical account of the events leading to the culinary monopoly of the 21st century.</p>
                <p>The Franchise Wars began as an economic competition but quickly escalated into a full-scale corporate conflict that would reshape the very fabric of global culinary culture.</p>

                <h3>The Initial Skirmishes</h3>
                <p>What started as aggressive marketing campaigns and territory disputes in the 2020s evolved into more direct confrontations by the late 2020s. Fast food chains began acquiring smaller competitors at an unprecedented rate, consolidating power and resources.</p>

                <h3>The Menu Offensive</h3>
                <p>By 2028, the remaining major chains launched what historians now call "The Menu Offensive" - a period of radical menu innovation and price wars designed to eliminate competition. This phase saw the introduction of increasingly extreme food items and dining experiences, pushing the boundaries of culinary science.</p>

                <h3>The Final Battle</h3>
                <p>The conflict reached its climax in 2032 when the last remaining chains engaged in what would be known as "The Final Battle for Fast Food Supremacy." Through a combination of strategic acquisitions, revolutionary flavor science, and unparalleled supply chain resilience, Taco Bell emerged as the sole survivor.</p>

                <h3>The New Order</h3>
                <p>In the aftermath, all restaurants became Taco Bell. The diversity of global cuisine was preserved through Taco Bell's adaptive menu strategy, incorporating elements from vanquished competitors into their offerings while maintaining their distinctive brand identity.</p>
